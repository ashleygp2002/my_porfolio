        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Ashley Gonzalez Perez, a passionate developer with experience in AI, deep learning, and web development. I love building elegant interfaces and solving real-world problems with tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've collaborated on projects involving large language models, responsive websites, and intelligent automation systems. I'm currently exploring how AI can understand human emotions and social cues to improve communication.
